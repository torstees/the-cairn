## What This Project Is

**The Cairn** is a web application for learning and retaining traditional Irish music tunes.
It helps students manage practice time using spaced repetition, ABC notation display,
and a structured progression system from "Just Learning" to "Solo Ready".

The immediate use case is a single user (the developer) acting as their own teacher.
The architecture must support multiple students and teachers from day one —
multi-user is a near-term requirement, not an afterthought.

### Model file split rule
Keep all models in `models.py` until any single domain group exceeds 5 models.
At that point, convert to a `models/` package with one file per domain group
(e.g. `models/tunes.py`, `models/users.py`, `models/sets.py`).
Do not split preemptively.

---

## Naming Conventions

- **Files**: `snake_case.py`
- **Classes**: `PascalCase`
- **Functions / variables**: `snake_case`
- **Database tables**: `snake_case`, plural (e.g. `tune_settings`, `student_progress`)
- **Pydantic schemas**: suffix with `Create`, `Update`, `Read` (e.g. `TuneCreate`, `TuneRead`)
- **Router prefixes**: `/tunes`, `/sets`, `/practice`, `/progress`, `/warmups`, `/auth`
- **Template partials** (HTMX fragments): prefix with `_` (e.g. `_tune_card.html`)
- **HTMX targets**: `id` attributes in kebab-case (e.g. `tune-list`, `progress-badge-{id}`)

---

## Coding Conventions

### FastAPI
- All route handlers are `async def`
- Use dependency injection for DB sessions (`Depends(get_db)`)
- Return Pydantic schemas from API routes, not raw SQLAlchemy objects
- HTML routes return `TemplateResponse`; JSON routes return Pydantic models
- Group related routes in a router file and include it in `main.py`
- **No business logic in route handlers** — delegate everything to `services/`

The route/service boundary in practice:

```python
# WRONG — logic in route handler
@router.post("/progress/{tune_id}")
async def update_progress(tune_id: int, rating: int, db: AsyncSession = Depends(get_db)):
    progress = await db.get(StudentProgress, tune_id)
    progress.interval_days = progress.interval_days * 2.5
    progress.next_suggested = datetime.now() + timedelta(days=progress.interval_days)
    await db.commit()
    return progress

# CORRECT — route is only the HTTP boundary
@router.post("/progress/{tune_id}")
async def update_progress(tune_id: int, rating: int, db: AsyncSession = Depends(get_db)):
    return await progress_service.record_practice(db, tune_id, rating)
```

### SQLAlchemy
- Use the **2.0 style** `Mapped` / `mapped_column` syntax exclusively
- All models inherit from a shared `Base` defined in `database.py`
- All models also inherit from `TimestampMixin` (provides `created_at`, `updated_at`)
- Define `__tablename__` explicitly on every model
- Use `relationship()` with `back_populates` (never `backref`)
- Use `AsyncSession` only — never the synchronous `Session`

```python
# Canonical model pattern
class Tune(TimestampMixin, Base):
    __tablename__ = "tunes"

    id: Mapped[int] = mapped_column(primary_key=True)
    title: Mapped[str] = mapped_column(String(200), nullable=False)
    tune_type: Mapped[TuneType] = mapped_column(Enum(TuneType), nullable=False)

    settings: Mapped[list["TuneSetting"]] = relationship(back_populates="tune")
```

### Enums
- Define all domain enums in `models.py` using `enum.Enum`
- All enums inherit from `LabelledEnum` (defined in `models.py`) which
  provides a `.label` property via `value.replace("_", " ").title()`
- Never define `.label` directly on individual enum classes
- Keep storage values as `snake_case` strings; `.label` handles presentation

```python
class LabelledEnum(str, enum.Enum):
    @property
    def label(self) -> str:
        return self.value.replace("_", " ").title()

class ProgressStatus(LabelledEnum):
    just_learning     = "just_learning"
    getting_there     = "getting_there"
    nearly_there      = "nearly_there"
    session_ready     = "session_ready"
    committed         = "committed"
    performance_ready = "performance_ready"
    solo_ready        = "solo_ready"

    @property
    def label(self) -> str:
        return self.value.replace("_", " ").title()
```

### Alembic
- Generate migrations with: `alembic revision --autogenerate -m "short description"`
- Apply with: `alembic upgrade head`
- **Never edit a migration file after it has been committed**
- If a migration is wrong, generate a new one to correct it

### HTMX + Templates
- Prefer HTMX attributes for all server interactions
- Alpine.js is for UI state only (open/closed, active tab, toggle)
- Never fetch data from JavaScript — that is HTMX's responsibility
- Every HTMX partial must function as a standalone renderable fragment
- Markdown content (Content pages, `text_blurb` warmups) supports embedded
ABC notation via fenced ` ```abc ` code blocks. `render_markdown()` in
`cairn/services/content.py` renders the markdown server-side (the fenced
block passes through as `<pre><code class="language-abc">`);
`renderMarkdownAbcBlocks()` in `static/js/app.js` finds those blocks
client-side and replaces each with an `ABCJS.renderAbc()` rendering.
Never store rendered HTML in the database — only raw markdown.

---

## Domain Model: Key Entities

### Tune / TuneSetting
A `Tune` is the abstract entity (title, type, key). A `TuneSetting` is a specific
ABC notation version of that tune. One setting must always be flagged `is_core = True`.
Core settings contain no ornamentation unless it is structurally central to the tune.
Ornamented versions are separate settings, never mutations of the core.

### TuneSet
An ordered collection of one or more tunes intended to be played together.
There is no maximum length — sets of 5+ tunes are valid.
Member order is significant and must be preserved.

TuneSet carries two difficulty ratings:

| Field | Display name | Meaning | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| `peak_difficulty` | Peak Difficulty | Difficulty of the hardest tune in the set for a given instrument | Derived: `MAX` of member `TuneDifficulty.difficulty` |
| `flow_difficulty` | Flow Difficulty | How demanding the transitions and set organisation are | Manual rating, nullable until set |

`peak_difficulty` is computed at query time, never stored.
`flow_difficulty` uses the same 1–5 scale as tune difficulty but measures different things:

| Rating | Flow Difficulty means |
|---|---|
| 1 | Flows naturally; transitions feel obvious |
| 2 | Minor adjustment needed between tunes |
| 3 | Transitions require deliberate practice |
| 4 | Key/meter shifts or similar-feel confusion demand significant work |
| 5 | Expert-level set construction; very demanding transitions |

Mixed-meter sets (e.g. jig into reel) are valid but must have `flow_difficulty`
set manually. The auto-generator must never produce mixed-meter sets.

### StudentProgress
Progress is per **(student, tune, TuneBox)** — never global to a tune.
Unique constraint: `(user_id, tune_id, box_id)`.
The `next_suggested` field drives the spaced repetition retention queue,
scoped to the TuneBox. `bars_to_show` is derived from `status`, not stored.

### TuneBox

A `TuneBox` is a named, instrument-scoped catalog of tunes a student currently
works on or intends to learn. Each user may have multiple TuneBoxes (e.g. "Flute"
covering flute + tin_whistle, "Accordion" covering accordion). All session
planning, progress tracking, and practice list membership is scoped to a TuneBox.

A TuneBox has one or more associated `Instrument` values via `TuneBoxInstrument`.
Instruments that share technique (e.g. flute and tin_whistle) can share a box.

Tunes are added to a box via `TuneBoxEntry`, which carries an optional preferred
`TuneSetting` for that instrument context. On adding a tune, if exactly one
existing `TuneSetting` has an `instrument` matching any of the box's instruments,
auto-set it as the `TuneBoxEntry.setting_id`. If zero or multiple match, leave null.

**Setting resolution order** (most to least specific):
1. `TuneListEntry.setting_id` — active practice list override
2. `TuneBoxEntry.setting_id` — box-level preferred setting
3. First `TuneSetting` where `instrument` ∈ box's instrument list — auto-match
4. Core setting (`is_core = True`, `instrument = None`) — fallback

**Display name resolution order** (`TuneBoxEntry`/`TuneListEntry.display_alias_id`,
a `TuneAlias` a box or list can show instead of the tune's own title — #119):
1. `TuneListEntry.display_alias_id` — active practice list override
2. `TuneBoxEntry.display_alias_id` — box-level choice
3. `Tune.title` — fallback

Unlike settings, there's no instrument-based auto-match step for display
names — a tune with no alias chosen anywhere always falls straight back to
its own title. `cairn.services.tunes.resolve_display_context()` resolves
both the effective setting and display name together in one call.

### SettingProgress

Tracks progress on a specific `TuneSetting` (a particular version or arrangement)
within a box context. Created when a student tags a tune to a practice list with
a setting override and needs to start that version from scratch.

Unique constraint: `(user_id, setting_id, box_id)`.

`SettingProgress.status` always starts **below** the parent `StudentProgress.status`
for the same `(user, tune, box)` — the student is behind on this specific version.
When practice advances `SettingProgress.status` to equal `StudentProgress.status`,
the record is retired (it becomes redundant). The student may also retire it manually.

**Effective status rule**: when building session queues for a list where
`TuneListEntry.setting_id` is set, look for a `SettingProgress(user, setting, box)`
record first. If one exists, use its `status`. Otherwise fall back to
`StudentProgress(user, tune, box).status`.

### PracticeList

A named, intentional group of tunes within a TuneBox used to focus a practice
session. A PracticeList always belongs to exactly one TuneBox. Only one list per
user may be `is_active = True` at a time — enforced at the application layer.
A tune may appear on multiple lists simultaneously.

List membership is recorded in `TuneListEntry`, which carries:
- `setting_id` (nullable) — which setting to display during sessions using this
  list; also determines which `SettingProgress` record to use for effective status.
- `is_focus` — a smaller, explicit subset (#241) the session planner's learning
  queue rotates through (#244) instead of the whole list, once at least one
  entry is focused; expected to land around 8-12 tunes but with no hard cap.
- `focus_goal_reached_at` (nullable) — set once a focused entry's effective
  status reaches the list's `progress_goal`; cleared when the user responds to
  the resulting prompt, however they respond (`set_focus`/`clear_focus_prompt`
  in `cairn/services/lists.py`).

**Two list types:**

*Repertoire* — goal-driven learning list. Reaching a tune's `progress_goal`
never deletes its `TuneListEntry` (Domain Rule 14, revised for #241/#243) — the
list stays a durable record even after a tune "graduates". If the entry is
focused, `focus_goal_reached_at` is set once instead, so the session UI can
prompt the user to choose whether to un-focus it; non-focused entries need no
action at all. This check runs against the user's *active* Repertoire list
only, whenever effective status changes.

*Woodshed* — intensive focus list. Tunes are never auto-removed. Once a tune's
effective status reaches `progress_goal` it leaves the learning queue but becomes
a high-priority retention tune for sessions using that list. Woodshed-tagged tunes
in the retention queue bypass the SM-2 `next_suggested` gate and are weighted to
the top; untagged box tunes still require `next_suggested ≤ now`.

`progress_goal` must be strictly above `just_learning`. Default: `committed`.

A Repertoire/Woodshed list also carries nullable session-shape overrides
(#241/#242): `warmup_pct`/`review_pct`/`learning_pct`/`retention_pct` (0-100,
null → this section's defaults) and `learning_tune_count`/
`review_tune_count`/`retention_tune_count` (null → unlimited, i.e. today's
fill-by-time behavior for that category). Set from the `/practice/plan`
form's "Session Shape" section (#246) — submitted values always shape that
one session (`build_session`'s per-call overrides, resolved ahead of the
list's own stored value), and only get written back onto the list itself
when "Save as this list's default" is checked
(`update_list_preferences`, `cairn/services/lists.py`).

**Session queue logic** (all scoped to the active TuneBox; #244):

With an active Repertoire/Woodshed list, `cairn/services/session_plan.py`'s
`build_session` resolves each of warmup/review/learning/retention's percent
into its own minute budget against `total_minutes` (defaults `warmup=10,
review=10, learning=50, retention=30`, summing to 100), then fills each
category up to its budget *and* its tune-count override (whichever binds
first). Unused budget cascades forward instead of vanishing (#253) —
warmup (if no `WarmupItem` exists at all) → learning → review (skipped
entirely, its whole share cascading, when the list has no focused entries)
→ retention — plus a single backward top-up of whatever retention still
can't spend, back into learning then review (retention running dry is the
only way anything survives the whole forward pass, so it's the only
source for that last step). A tune-count cap always binds, regardless of
whether the budget funding an item came from that category's own share or
from elsewhere. With no active list, the session keeps its original
fixed-10%-warmup / fill-remaining-time behavior unchanged, with no
reallocation.

If the active list has at least one focused entry, its learning queue
rotates through that subset only — oldest `StudentProgress.last_practiced`
first (nulls, i.e. never practiced, first of all), tie-broken by proximity
to goal — instead of the whole list; zero focused entries falls back to the
full-list queue below, unchanged. A **review** queue (new `SessionItemType`)
picks up focused tunes bumped from today's learning rotation that were a
`learning`-type item in a past session for this box, most-recent qualifying
session first, deduped by tune (reaching into an older session only for a
tune the newer ones don't cover); a tune never previously in rotation is
never a review candidate.

| Session type | Learning queue | Retention queue |
|---|---|---|
| Repertoire list | Focus subset (or full list if nothing's focused) where effective_status < goal; rotation order (or proximity-to-goal, full-list fallback) | Full box, status ≥ goal, next_suggested ≤ now; exclude session learning tunes |
| Woodshed list | Same as Repertoire's learning rule | Full box, status ≥ goal; woodshed-tagged tunes bypass SM-2 gate and are top-weighted; exclude session learning tunes |
| No active list | Full box, status < `committed`, weighted by proximity to `committed` | Full box, status ≥ `committed`, next_suggested ≤ now |

SM-2 fields (`interval_days`, `ease_factor`) update normally in all cases, including
when a Woodshed session triggers practice ahead of the scheduled interval.

### Difficulty
Difficulty is always per instrument. Never put a single difficulty score
on `Tune` itself. Use `TuneDifficulty` with an instrument enum.

## Planned: Pedagogy and Technique Layer

This section is intentionally incomplete. A pedagogical content system is planned
but not yet fully designed. Do not make structural decisions that would close off
this design space.

### What is known

The app intends to go beyond tune notation and ornamentation reference to provide
rich explanations of *why* traditional music techniques exist and *when* to use them.
The core insight driving this: ornamentation in Irish traditional music is functional,
not decorative. Each ornament solves a specific musical problem (e.g. rolls maintain
pulse on sustained notes; cuts and strikes accent and articulate). Students who
understand the function will use ornaments musically and spontaneously; students
who only learn where ornaments appear in specific tunes are working from a script.

This extends beyond ornamentation to any technique or concept that traditional
pedagogy leaves implicit but that adult learners benefit from having made explicit.

### What this implies for existing models

`OrnamentDefinition` must support this richer pedagogical intent. At minimum it needs:
- `functional_purpose` — why this ornament exists musically
- `when_to_use` — the musical conditions that call for it
- `when_not_to_use` — equally important
- `instrument_notes` — behaviour varies significantly across instruments
- `regional_variation` — e.g. Sligo rolls vs Clare rolls

### What is not yet designed

- A broader long-form content type for conceptual scaffolding
  (e.g. "What is pulse and why does it matter", "Why pipes and flute ornament
  differently from fiddle", "How to listen for ornamentation in recordings")
- How this content is surfaced during practice sessions
- Whether this content is teacher-authored, student-facing only, or both
- What other implicit traditional pedagogy concepts belong here beyond ornamentation
  (rhythmic feel, regional style, tone production, breathing, etc.)

### Constraints for the agent

- Do not implement `OrnamentDefinition` without the fields listed above
- Do not design any content storage as a simple key-value or tag system —
  the pedagogy layer will need richer structure than that
- Do not assume ornamentation is the only concept this layer will cover
- Leave the content type for long-form conceptual articles as an open question
  until the design is ready

## Domain Rules (Invariants — Never Violate)

1. **Every tune has exactly one `is_core = True` TuneSetting where
    `instrument` is null** — the traditional version valid for all
    instruments. Instrument-specific arrangements are non-core settings
    with `instrument` set explicitly. Never mark an instrument-specific
    setting as `is_core = True`.

2. **Progress is per student, per tune, per TuneBox.** The unique constraint on
   `StudentProgress` is `(user_id, tune_id, box_id)`. Never modify a `Tune`
   record to reflect a student's progress.

3. **Spaced repetition state lives in `StudentProgress`** (`next_suggested`,
   `interval_days`, `ease_factor`), scoped to a TuneBox.
   Never compute next review date in a route handler.

4. **ABC notation is never mutated to add ornamentation.** Ornamented versions
   are always separate `TuneSetting` records or derived at render time.

5. **Difficulty is per instrument.** All difficulty queries must specify an instrument.

6. **TuneSet member order is always preserved.** Use an explicit `order`
   integer column on the join model, not insertion order.

7. **`peak_difficulty` for a set is always `MAX` of member tune difficulties**
   for a given instrument. Never store it; always compute it.

8. **Mixed-meter sets require a manual `flow_difficulty` rating.**
   The session planner must never auto-generate mixed-meter sets.

9. **`flow_difficulty` and tune `difficulty` use the same 1–5 scale
   but are never interchangeable.** Always use field names and display
   labels to distinguish them in UI and queries.

10. **Transposition is always applied at render time, never stored.**
    The ABC notation stored in `TuneSetting` is always the original
    untransposed version. Transposed versions are derived on request
    via `abc_utils.py` and returned to the client directly.
    Never write a transposed ABC string back to the database.

11. **`mutation_notation` format is not yet defined.**
    The field exists as a placeholder only. Do not implement any
    rendering, parsing, or transformation logic for `mutation_notation`
    until the format is decided in Phase 3. Store as raw text only.

12. **A TuneBox must have at least one instrument.** Enforce at the service
    layer; never create a TuneBox without at least one `TuneBoxInstrument` entry.

13. **Only one PracticeList per user may be `is_active = True` at any time.**
    Enforce at the application layer when activating a list.

14. **Reaching a Repertoire goal never deletes a `TuneListEntry`** (revised
    for #241/#243) — the list stays a durable record even after a tune
    "graduates". When `record_practice`, `set_status`, or `advance_status_one`
    changes a tune's effective status, check the user's *active* Repertoire
    list (within the same box): if the tune's entry is focused (`is_focus`)
    and effective status has reached the list's `progress_goal`, set
    `focus_goal_reached_at` once (don't re-bump it on later practice). A
    non-focused entry needs no action.

15. **`SettingProgress.status` is always ≤ `StudentProgress.status`** for the
    same `(user, tune, box)`. A `SettingProgress` record that has caught up to
    the parent progress should be retired, not left in place.

16. **Session queue building is always scoped to the active TuneBox.**
    Never mix tunes from different boxes in a single session.

17. **Practice list type determines retention queue behaviour, not just learning
    queue behaviour.** See the session queue table in the PracticeList section.
    Implement retention builders as separate strategies, not one function with
    conditional overrides.

18. **Any tune/setting carrying a `thesession_tune_id` / `thesession_setting_id`
    must show an attribution link back to `https://thesession.org/tunes/{id}`
    wherever that data is displayed.** Required by TheSession-data's ODbL
    license — this must hold for any future page/view/export that surfaces
    the data, not just the ones built in TODO 8.3.

## Progress Status: Display Logic

| Status | Label | Bars shown | Suggested practice slot |
|---|---|---|---|
| `just_learning` | Just Learning | All bars | 10–15 min |
| `getting_there` | Getting There | All bars | 5–10 min |
| `nearly_there` | Nearly There | First 8 bars | 3–5 min |
| `session_ready` | Session Ready | First 4 bars | 2–3 min |
| `committed` | Committed | Title + key only | Spaced rep queue |
| `performance_ready` | Performance Ready | Title + key only | Spaced rep queue |
| `solo_ready` | Solo Ready | Title + key only | Spaced rep queue |

`bars_to_show` is always derived from `status` at render time — never stored.

---

## Logging

Logging is configured in `cairn/logging_config.py` and initialised once at startup in `main.py`.

### Per-module logger

Every module that logs gets its own logger at the top of the file:

```python
import logging
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
```

Never call `logging.info()` / `logging.debug()` directly — always use the module logger.

### Log levels

| Level | When to use |
|---|---|
| `DEBUG` | Diagnostic detail useful during development (query parameters, row counts, branch taken) |
| `INFO` | Normal business events worth knowing about in production (setting changed, tune added to list) |
| `WARNING` | Unexpected but recoverable conditions |
| `ERROR` | Failures that need investigation |

### Structured extra fields

Pass domain context as `extra={}` so it is indexed in Cloud Logging:

```python
logger.info("setting propagated", extra={"tune_id": tune_id, "list_ids": list_ids})
```

### Environment detection

| Environment | Output |
|---|---|
| GCP (Cloud Run, App Engine, etc.) | Structured JSON to stdout; ingested by Cloud Logging |
| Local interactive shell with `rich` | Rich pretty-printer with tracebacks |
| Non-interactive / CI | Plain timestamped text |

Set `CAIRN_LOG_LEVEL` env var to override the default `INFO` level.

## Git Workflow

- Always create a feature branch before committing (`git checkout -b fix/<slug>` or `feature/<slug>`)
- Check the current branch with `git branch` before staging any files — never assume the branch
- Push with `gh pr create` after committing; include the issue number in the PR body if applicable
- **Never commit directly to `main`**
- **Never merge or close a PR** — the user reviews, tests, and merges all PRs themselves
- Whenever `pyproject.toml` changes (version bump, dependency add/remove), immediately run
  `uv lock` and commit the updated `uv.lock` in the same commit — CI and the deploy script both
  run `uv sync --locked`, which fails on any mismatch between the two files

### Closing issues via PR

GitHub only auto-closes issues when a closing keyword (`closes`, `fixes`, `resolves`) appears
in the **PR body or a commit message** — the PR title is ignored for this purpose.
Always put the closing reference in the PR body:

```
## Summary
...

Closes #42
```

Never rely on a keyword in the PR title to close an issue.

### GitHub Issues

When creating issues with `gh issue create`, always apply the most appropriate type label:

- `bug` — something is broken or behaving incorrectly
- `enhancement` — new feature or improvement to existing behaviour
- `documentation` — docs-only change

If the user states or implies a priority level, also apply the matching label:

- `Priority - High` — blocking other work or urgent UX problem
- `Priority - Medium` — important but not blocking
- `Priority - Low` — nice to have, can wait

Example: `gh issue create --label "enhancement" --label "Priority - High" ...`

Omit the priority label when the user has not indicated one.

## What the Agent Must Not Do

- Do not install packages with `pip` — use `uv add`
- Do not create migration files unless explicitly instructed
- Do not add JavaScript frameworks beyond HTMX and Alpine.js
- Do not write inline `<style>` blocks — use Tailwind utility classes
- Do not put business logic in route handlers — it belongs in `services/`
- Do not use synchronous `Session` — only `AsyncSession`
- Do not use `backref` — use `back_populates`
- Do not modify any file under `alembic/versions/`
- Do not store computed values (`peak_difficulty`, `bars_to_show`) as columns
- Do not generate mixed-meter sets automatically
- Do not split `models.py` into a package unless the 5-model-per-domain rule is met
- Do not use PowerShell or cmd.exe — all shell commands must be run via WSL
- Do not use `print()` for debug output — use `logging.getLogger(__name__)` and the appropriate level (`debug`, `info`, `warning`, `error`)

---

## Testing

- Framework: `pytest` with `pytest-asyncio`
- All tests use an in-memory SQLite database configured in `conftest.py`
- Every service function must have at least one test
- Use realistic domain data for test fixtures — actual Irish tune titles,
  correct keys, valid ABC notation snippets, plausible instrument names.
  Avoid placeholder values like "test", "foo", or "key_placeholder".
- Route tests use FastAPI's `AsyncClient` from `httpx`
- Run tests: `make test`

## Definition of Done

A task is complete when:

1. The code runs without errors (`make dev` starts cleanly)
2. `make test` passes with no failures
3. `make lint` passes with no violations
4. Any new model has a corresponding Alembic migration generated (not necessarily applied)
5. Any new route has a corresponding Jinja2 template or returns valid JSON
6. No business logic lives in a route handler
7. All new enums have a `.label` property
8. No rule in "What the Agent Must Not Do" has been violated
9. The agent has not split `models.py` unless the split rule threshold was reached
10. The corresponding `TODO.md` item is marked `[x]`
11. `DESIGN.md` is updated if the task changes the architecture, data model, key patterns, or domain invariants

## Makefile Targets

```makefile
make dev        # Start uvicorn with --reload
make test       # Run pytest
make migrate    # alembic upgrade head
make migration  # alembic revision --autogenerate (prompts for -m message)
make shell      # Open Python REPL with app context
make lint       # ruff check + ruff format --check
make fmt        # ruff format (auto-fix)
make content    # Import markdown content pages from content/ (scripts/import_content.py)
make thesession-import  # Refresh TheSession.org tune reference side tables (scripts/import_thesession.py)
```

## UX Principles
Aesthetic: warm pub/cottage kitchen — earthy tones, serif typography, soft textures.
Primary device: iPad in landscape, used at a piano or music stand.
Touch targets must be generous. ABC notation must be legible at arm's length.
Navigation should be minimal — content first.

## Current Phase

**Phase 1 — Solo Tool**

Scope: single user, tune + setting management, ABC notation display,
manual progress tracking, basic practice session planning.
Sets schema is defined in Phase 1 but UI is Phase 2.
No teacher/student workflow, no group features yet.

See `TODO.md` for the current task list.
